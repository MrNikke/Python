One of my first coding projects.
This program is a simple chatbot inspired by Eliza, a classic AI therapist simulation. It processes user input and generates responses based on predefined rules. 
It simulates a simple chatbot-style conversation, making it feel like the bot is engaging in a basic psychological discussion.
